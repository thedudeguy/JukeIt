------------------------------------

## Pro Version

JukeIt (formerly JukeBukkit) allows users to craft blank discs, called Obsidyiscs. You can burn these discs with music of your liking, music that is hosted on the internet somewhere, and play the music on your obsidyiscs in jukeboxes, also crafted by players.

## Features

* Craft discs called Obsidyiscs
* Attach .ogg's, wav's, or mp3's to an Obsidyisc in which that particular disc will play.
* All players within range of a jukebox can hear an Obsidyisc playing.
* Build numerous types of jukeboxes with different ranges.
* Activate jukeboxes via redstone.

### Upgrade to Pro for even more features, such as:
* Event more jukeboxes with even greater ranges!
* Built in Server to host Audio files on your own server!
* Allow your users to upload their music to the server via the web gui.
* Craft jukebox modifiers such as speakers which increase audible range.
* Craft Needle modifiers such as Blaze Needle which increases audible range by 30%.
* Use Custom Texture Packs
* Loopable Music with the Repeater block!

## Requirements

JukeIt is built and tested against

* SpoutCraftPlugin at least build 1.6.4-b1
* SpoutCraft at least build 1.6.4-b5
* CraftBukkit 1.6.4-R2.0

## Installation

* JukeIt _Requires_ SpoutPlugin to run.
* This does not require users to use Spoutcraft to be able to log in to the server. However, players without Spoutcraft will be unable to see jukeboxes or hear them, and will only see Flint.
* Install by placing jukeit.jar into your bukkit server's plugin folder.
* Restart Server

*Important If you plan to use the Web Server* (Pro Version Only)

* After restarted, you *must* edit the config.yml for JukeIt.
* Set the minecraftServerHostname config option to your server's Domain name, or IP Address, that your user's use to connect to your server.
* Make sure to set the webServerPort to an open port on your server, and the appropriate port forwarding has been established so that users can connect to the webServer.
* Restart Server 

## Upgrading to JukeIt 3.3

Your old discs will no longer work. Bukkit has made it more difficult to use custom NBT Tags. Therefore, I was forced to use a new method of storing URL Data. Previously burned discs will no longer play.
